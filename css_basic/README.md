# My First Portfolio

This is my first portfolio project created using HTML and CSS. The project showcases a basic webpage layout using CSS Flexbox for positioning elements.

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: The main HTML file containing the structure of the webpage.
- `styles.css`: The CSS file containing styles for the webpage.
- `base.css`: Additional CSS styles applied to the webpage.

## How to View the Project

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser to view the project.

## Requirements

- All files should end with a new line.
- No external libraries or frameworks were used (e.g., React, VueJS, Bootstrap).
- The code is W3C compliant and validates with W3C-Validator.
